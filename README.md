## Description
The Great Banana Dash was developed as a third-year academic project, with an emphasis on showcasing practical applications of data structures and algorithms in gameplay systems. From AI behavior to in-game mechanics, the technical foundation supports a fun and responsive kart racing experience.
This project was a solo project. I designed, coded and created all art assets myself.
